# Valheim

## Description
This JavaScript application generates secure passwords for users based on their preferences. It features a simple user interface with a "Generate Password" button. When the button is clicked, the user is prompted to specify the length of the desired password (between 8 and 128 characters) and select various criteria, including whether to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters.

Once the user's preferences are collected, the application generates a password using the selected criteria. It creates a character pool based on the chosen character sets and then randomly selects characters from this pool to create the final password.
